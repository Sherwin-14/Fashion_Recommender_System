I've developed a fashion recommendation system using the Myntra dataset, which utilizes the Annoy algorithm to provide personalized product suggestions. By indexing high-dimensional vectors and efficiently searching for nearest neighbors, Annoy enables fast and accurate recommendations. My system takes user preferences and behavior into account to deliver tailored fashion recommendations, enhancing the shopping experience for Myntra customers.
